            <h2>The Comp Sci Club</h2>
            <p>Hey! As said <a href="index.html">here</a> this club is about learning and creation. If you're interested in joining, feel free to come by <strong>Room 404 at 2:15 on Tuesdays</strong> (This is when we meet).</p>
            <p>Although we only meet once a week, everyone is free to continue working on projects in their free time. This also makes it easy to miss a meeting without any consequence (except being called out). It is highly encouraged to show up to most meetings.</p>
            <h2>Are you Interested?</h2>
            <p>If you're interested to join but are hesitant because you feel you lack experience, feel free to join anyway. If you do want to learn, <a href="https://hackclub.com/">HackClub</a> provides resources to help you with whatever you need. In addition, you have each other to help you out with something you can't figure out yourself. If you need any help outside of the meetings on Tuesday, <em>Slack</em> can be used to ask others for help.</p>
            <h2>When you join</h2>
            <p>A couple of things will happen when you join. First, you'll be added to our <a href="/members.html">Members</a> page! Next, at your first meeting, you will start with the default HackClub introduction website builder resource. Depending on your experience you could get through this fairly quickly or not as fast, and either is okay. In addition, we'll also have you sign up to <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>, which is sort of like Google docs for programmers. Finally, We'll have you join the <em>Slack</em> team which is run by <a href="https://hackclub.com/">HackClub.</a> The Slack team gives you the opportunity to talk with other people interested in computer science like you. The Slack consists of all the members from every HackClub associated club. When you join this, you will need to follow their <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/master/CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. What you do represents our school, so don't do anything you know you shouldn't.</p>
            <p>After you complete the first HackClub task, you have the option to join other people in their projects, start your own project, or work on more of the workshops provided by HackClub. This club is not an introductory class. Although you need no experience to join and can learn at your own pace, you will probably learn a lot more than you will in an introductory class here.</p>
            <p>Finally, HackClub is not just an organization that provides a few resources and attatches it's name to the club. HackClub, in addition to it's resources and help provided, is a huge community of people from around the world who are also in computer science clubs. The community consists of over 1000 members, active and inactive, who share common interests with each other. It's a very interesting thing to be a part of.</p>
